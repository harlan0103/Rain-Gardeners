# Rain-Gardeners
Rain Gardeners consists of 4 second-year students from CMU ETC. Working with our client, The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, we are creating a fun and intuitive digital tool using AR technology for educators at Lincoln School who wants to educate 3-5 grade students about the ecology of a rain garden.
